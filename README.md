TACO - The talking computer.
Based on an old project in Turbo/Quick BASIC of mine from the nineties.

Features:

- Recognizes and stores personal information (name, location, age, hobby, family, friends, characteristics, etc.).
- The user starts the conversation; Taco asks for the name and remembers it.
- Information is stored per person in a separate text file.
- Recognizes relationships (“John is my brother”) and establishes connections between people.
- Can later ask questions based on stored information.
- Recognizes personal pronouns (“I”, “you”, “he/she”, etc.).
--Also stores information about Taco itself and third parties.

Goals:

We want to expand Taco into an intelligent chatbot that can recognize, understand, and process language without using a large language model (LLM).
This is possible—using a combination of a dictionary (lexicon) and a grammatical model (rules, tables).

Disclaimer: 

Up until now the code was generated by prompts in Copilot.
It is limited to just a few features and a small set of grammar rules and a small dictionary.
For now the language is Dutch, but should be easy to convert or extend to other languages.
